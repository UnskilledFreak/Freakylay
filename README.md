# Freakylay
An alternative and customizable overlay for [DataPuller Mod](https://github.com/kOFReadie/DataPuller) which lets you choose your own style.

## Features

- change **background and font color like you want**, even with transparency
- supports long and short names for modifiers (Instant Fail / IF)
- if in practice mode, it displays the offset instead of the whole percentage
    - 130% => +30%
    - 80% => -20%
- displays accuracy, player health and time in a nice circular progressbar
- it hides itself when in menus
- test it with a preview image of Beat Saber without having the game to run

## Url - give me the Link:
It is hosted via HTTP so you can use the IP feature too:

See [Configuration](#Configuration) for more options. 

## How do I customize it?

**Just double-click somewhere on the page!**

Use the opening options panel to customize the overlay like you want!
You can close the options panel simply by double-click somewhere else.

## Configuration

The option panel will generate the URL by itself. Copy the URL and insert it into something useful like OBS or other recording or streaming software.
